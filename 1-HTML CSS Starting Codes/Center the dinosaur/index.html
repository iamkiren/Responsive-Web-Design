    <h2>About dinosaurs</h2>

    <h3>Their History</h3>
    <p>Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles of the clade Dinosauria. </p>

      They first appeared during the Triassic period, between 243 and 233.23 million years ago, although the exact
      origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research.
      <br> <br>
      They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201 million years
      ago; their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Reverse genetic engineering and the
      fossil record both demonstrate that birds are modern feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier theropods
      during the late Jurassic Period.
      <br> <br>
      As such, birds were the only dinosaur lineage to survive the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million
      years ago. Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs, or birds; and non-avian dinosaurs, which are
      all dinosaurs other than birds. This article deals primarily with non-avian dinosaurs.

      <h3>People love dinosaurs!</h3>

      <p>Since the first dinosaur fossils were recognized in the early 19th century, mounted fossil dinosaur skeletons
        have been major attractions at museums around the world, and dinosaurs have become an enduring part of world
        culture.</p>
      <p>The large sizes of some dinosaur groups, as well as their seemingly monstrous and fantastic nature, have
        ensured dinosaurs' regular appearance in best-selling books and films, such as Jurassic Park.
      </p>

      <p>Persistent public enthusiasm for the animals has resulted in significant funding for dinosaur science, and new
        discoveries are regularly covered by the media.</p>

    <p>"There's an incomparable rush that comes from finding dinosaur bones. You know you're the first person to lay
      hands on a critter that lived 80 or 90 million years ago."
